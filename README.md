## Student Notes
If you have any bonus specs, bonus or any details the TA's should know, you should include it here:

1). A MapSelection State has been implemented where in the MenuState you can press the "Select a Map" option where you will be presented with 4 maps. Each option will upload a different Map.

2). A new Map was also created, called map4. 

3). A special song was implemented in this new and exclusive map.

4). In the ChoosePlayerState & PauseState you are able to move between state and Interact with the screen by clicking your mouse. The keys for quit and resume were implemented in the pauseState for completion of Phase2 but there is no need to actually use it. You can just click one of the selections provided.

5). A new fruit was added. Instead of cheating and using 'm' to get an extra life we implemented the 'SENZU BEAN FRUIT' giving the player '1' extra life if they are below 3. This fruit will appear on the opposite side of the player and it should be used wisely.

6). Return to Main Menu button has been added to Win State, GameOver state and MapSelect state for quality of life.

7). Graphics has been added to Win State for a more eye catching UI.
